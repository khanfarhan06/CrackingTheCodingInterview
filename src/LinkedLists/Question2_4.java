//QUESTION 2.4: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit.
//              The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1â€™s digit is at the head of the list.
//              Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
//EXAMPLE:      Input: (3 -> 1 -> 5 -> null), (5 -> 9 -> 2 -> null)
//              Output: 8 -> 0 -> 8 -> null

//IMPORTANT POINTS IN APPROACH TAKEN:
// ~When we have heads of two list, add them to find their sum and corresponding carry
// ~The head of the sum for these list will be the sum%10
// ~Next node of this node will be the sum for the rest of the lists, hence recursive call can be used here
